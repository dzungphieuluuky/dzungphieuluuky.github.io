My blog started, indirectly, because I was 15 minutes late to class. Actually, the idea of having a personal blog began in the university library, but without the **confrontation** on the first day of uni, it ot have happened either.

It was the first lecture o Introduction to Programming at university. I rushed in to find most seats taken after arriving abou 15 minutes late (ha just moved from  countryside to the city, so  biological clock dnt adted quickly enough)except one seat next to a guy who looked focused. I slid into the seat. After a few conversations, I found out that this guy had a similar background  moth of us had enrolled in this university with awards from national olympiad competitions—mine in physicsn i math. By some turn of events, we ended up whispering not about code or why we chose this university after high school, but about quantum physics and relativity. Despite having a background in mathematics, especially combinatorics and number theory, he knw quite bit about physics and its fndations, itng popular names  Einstein, Heisenberg, and Schrdinger.

He was brilliant—a graduate of a top high school in the city, with a mind for math that both impressed and intimidated me. Yet, we found common ground in nerdy, big ideas. Our interests were like two sides of a coin: he was drawn deeply into the human world—religion, societylike*Sapiens* and other major works about humanity, belief systems, and imaginary orders. I was pulled toward the abstract and objective aspects of nature—consciousness, spacetime, and the metaphysics of everything beyond us. Metaphysics is one of the biggest pillars of general philosophy, which focuses on looking at the world from a higher perspectivee usibstract reasoning to draw out some of the most niversal principles from the physical world instead of dissecting each phenomenon individually—hence the name eta*-physics.

An unexpected friendship bloomed from that awkward first meeting. It felt a bit like a duality: Naruto and Sasuke, perhaps, but with fewer fights and more library chats.

During those chats, he’d share his wild, often startling theories on society and ethics. Some were so out-of-this-world that I’d joke he needed a warning label, or society might confront him n a beautiful evening. One afternoon in the library, chatting about everything  relfter finishing our last examinations o the second semester, half-amused and half-serious, I told him, “Why ont you startog? These ideas aret the kind of things people hear in daily lie. Perhaps youll find someone with the same minds.”

I didn’t think much of it, but that sentence seemed to light a spark in him. He got distracted for days and began pouring his thoughts into Google Docs. When I asked why he didn’t just build a website already, he said something that stuck with me: if he focused on building the site first, he’d lose the motivation to write. The ideas had to come first. Actually, I think the real reason is he hat built anything web-related before, so building a website out of the blue without experience would be challenging—so, yeah, he tried to avoid it and prioritize ideas before they evapored.

Months passed, and the tables turned. He kept nudging me: “When are you starting a blog?” I always refused. It sounded tedious, and I didn’t feel I had anything pressing to say. Why would anyone care? At that time, I also dt have any specific passion to start a blog. When yo about something, you at least eed something in ind, right? But for me, a hysicsing to fit into the discrete mindset of computer science basics, I surely ha nothing to share with everyone at the time.

But something shifted recently. Maybe it was the quiet realization that writing helps me think—and somehow makes me feel at ease. Maybe I finally felt that little fire to share, not for an audience, but for the simple act of putting ideas into words. Maybe writing a blog about the experiences and hardshipve encountered would be a lifeboat and a perfect guide for me in the future when, again, I feel lost in my mind. So here I am, using a simple template I found on GitHub (I’m not hardcore enough to code a site from scratch), writing these first lines.

I’m not sure who will read this, and that’s okay. This space is for me—to explore ideas that catch my eye, from math and physics to philosophy and what to eat for dinner. To document a learning journey. To welcome the random and the yet-unknown.

A blog, it turns out, can begin with being late, a conversation, and a friend who wouldn’t let a good idea stay quiet.

$...$Two years later$...$

A lot has changed since that conversation.m no longer a fresh in mfirst year  now a thirdyear undergraduate, with a clearer mind and a stronger mental model, and, most importantly, I’ve figured out what I want to do and research.

Surviving dozens of projects  many subjects from my first year through my second year, I that my formal coursework hasnt led me to the technical frontiers I find most compelling. While my schools curriculum hasnt yet dived deep into the AI and eep learning topics that spark my curiosity, I havent waited. For over a year now, starting sometime in the second semester  my second year at university, Ive been on a self-directed journey down the rabbit holes of reinforcement learning and deep learning foundations. There are a few reasons why deep learning caught my attention at this time:
 First, it uses much more derivatives, integrals, differentiation, and many things born from calculus and mathematical analysis. Those are what I dealt with a thousand  gains back when I was competing in the National Physics OlympiadI slept with them every night and woke up with them every morning during my preparation.
*   Second, it wsinspiration from nture: deep learning borrows the neural architecture inspired by the biological structure the human brain, while reinforcement learning embraces the idea of trial and error in the learning process of nearly every form of life n Earth, including us humans.
 And finally, I just wanted to cape my boring daiime—to break away fromspr  the normal workload oschool and find there that I f passionate about,  tediousness seemed too luxurious to have even once.

After a long riodi of self-teaching the foundation knowledge o deep learning and reinforcement learnin nce again, captivated y mind with its beauty and mystery the generative power of diffusion models. My background s  physics, that deep learning  physics to AI to enhance its power is always captivating to me. I still remember learning about the dynamics of particles  dynamical systems we have heat transfer between particles in the same material (sa, a long tube wito end and one hot end, wh hee hegradually transfer frohot to coldnternal friction between layers of fluid flowing through an environment,nan the system enty unhere ayers slide against each other, creating friction f slsome layers and speeds up oth ers; and the final phenomenonh guess from my talk, is the diffusion process. In thprocess,rticles scatter throughout a contanmetiont, increasing the system’s entropy until the particleenty unti nearly uniform everywhere. Somehow, computer scientists have successfully br the idea of diffusion processes into generative modelscreate-of-the-art models in image generationand comenow theyre potentially bekfor other generation tasks, including text in natural language processing and trajectories/rewardsn robotics learning.

This process of teaching myself complex topics has taught me something crucial: the best way to solidify your understanding is to articulate it clearly for someone else. The idea of this self-teaching techniquehi ei aundon the internet. There are a few keywords when talking abs:
 **Rubber duck debugging**: e, as undergraduates majoring in computer science/information technology (or whever we call ourselves), may have heard about this once or. It tells us that the best way to debug an error i a  to use a rubber duckinnocent and adorableand teach it about the code wereing. Every detail and component of our code must be articulated clearly enough so that a cute thing like a rubber duck can understand. That way, within the next nute or two, we might figure out where the bug is and eliminate it.
*   **The Feynman Technique**:  technique is named a one of the most popular physicists iworld history for his contributions to ien the complexity of quantum electrodynamics (QED). He is called the best teacher, best explainer, and best scientific communicator in the world due to his curiosity, sense of humor, anunparalleled understanding of the physical world and pedagogical talent. The technique is the same as rubber duck debugging i tells you to try to articulate an idea you just learn  its form so that e a five-year-old child could understand it. Given the complexity i. en the complexity of quantum electrodynamicsh I believe  incomprehensible enough that most of us wouldnt understand itI strongly believe the technique this man used is  cornerstone for the self-teag process.

Ultimately, you dont truly know a concept until you can explain it. Thats the first reason Im here now.

This blog, then, is my new tool for thinking. It’s a place where I plan to break down the ideas I’m wrestling with—from the multimodal action spaces in diffusion policies to the exploration-exploitation trade-off in deep reinforcement learning. By writing, I aim to crystallize my own knowledge. And by sharing, I hope to connect with others walking a similar, self-guided  learning, I have quite a strange opinion: what we strive to learn is what drives us to the top and stays with us for the rest of our daysny knowledge bestowed upon us that we take for granted wl never be  true companion and will soonplaced or abandoned. If my notes and explanations can help even one fellow learner, that would be a wonderful bonus.

But my interests arent confined to neural networks and loss functions. I also want to explore a different kind of model here: models of thought. I have a long-standing interest in philosophy, particularly epistemology (how we know what we knowthe philosophy o knowledge, mind, wisdom, and language) and metaphysics (the nature of reality, existence, objective and subjective matter, etc.). Sometimes, the questions in AI and the questions in philosophy feel surprisingly adjacent. What does it mean for a machine to learn? What is the nature of the world model an agent builds? What actually is consciousness, a concept we talk about as if we knew it, but which is ready to be replaced or redefined at any time? Writing will allow me to explore these parallels.

So, consider this blog a fusion of my two intellectual tracks. One is technical, focused on understanding and explaining the mechanisms of modern AI. The other is philosophical, focused on questioning the foundations of knowledge and existence that these technologies touch upon.

h, his long journey of persuading me to write a e successful than he thoughtjust earlier than I was ready to hear it. This space is my commitment to the process of learning, thinking, and sharing. Im not sure exactly where it will lead, but Im excited to find out.

Welcome.
