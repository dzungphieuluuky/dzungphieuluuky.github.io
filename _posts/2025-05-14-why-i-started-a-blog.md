My blog started, indirectly, because I was 15 minutes late to class. Actually, the idea of having a personal blog started on the lbrary of the university but without the **confrontation** on the first day to uni, it wouldn't happen either.

It was the first lecture on Introduction to Programming at university. I rushed in to find most seats taken after around 15 minutes late to the class (yeah that time I have just moved from my countryside to the city so the biological clock didn't adapt fast enough), except one next to a guy who looked focused. I slid into the seat. After a few talks I found out that this guy has some kind of similar background as me, both of us enrolled into this univeristy with our national olympiads compeition awards, I have physics and he has maths. By some turn of events, we ended up whispering not about code or why we choose this university as the next destination after high school, but about quantum physics and relativity. Despite having a background in mathematics especially in combinatorics and number theory, he knows quite well about physics and its foundations with popular names such as Einstein, Heisenberg and Schrodinger.

He was brilliant—a graduate of a top high school in the city, with a mind for maths that both impressed and intimidated me. Yet, we found common ground in nerdy, big ideas. Our interests were like two sides of a coin: he was drawn deeply into the human world—religion, society, history, devouring books like Homo Sapiens and those big books about humanity and history of beliefs and imaginary orders. I was pulled toward the abstract and objective things of nature—consciousness, spacetime, and the metaphysics of everything beyond us. Metaphysics is one of the biggest pillars of general philosophy, which focus on looking at the world from a higher view, using its abstract reasoning to draw out some of the most common principles from the physical world instead of specifically dissect each phenomenons, hence the name Meta-physics.

An unexpected friendship bloomed from that awkward first meeting. It felt a bit like a duality: Naruto and Sasuke, perhaps, but with fewer fights and more library chats.

During those chats, he’d share his wild, often startling theories on society and ethics. Some were so out-of-this-world that I’d joke he needed a warning label or the society might confront him in a beautiful evening. One afternoon in the library, chatting about everything out of relaxation after finishing our last examinations for the second semester, half-amused and half-serious, I told him, “Why wouldn't you start a blog? These ideas are not kind of things people often hear in daily lives. Perhaps you will find someone with the same mind as you.”

I didn’t think much of it, but that sentence seemed to light a spark in him. He got distracted for days, and began pouring his thoughts into Google Docs. When I asked why he didn’t just build a website already, he said something that stuck with me: if he focused on building the site first, he’d lose the motivation to write at all. The ideas had to come first. Actually I think the real reason is he has not built anything web-related before so building a website out of the blue without experience would be something harsh for him so, yeah he tried to avoid it and prioritize ideas first before they vaporize.

Months passed, and the tables turned. He kept nudging me: “When are you starting a blog?” I always refused. It sounded tedious, and I didn’t feel I had anything pressing to say. Why would anyone care? At that time I also don't have any specific passion to start a blog. When we try blogging about something, at least we have something in our minds, right? But for me, a passionate undergrad for physics who has been trying to fit into the discrete mindset of computer science basics, surely I have nothing to share with everyone at the time.

But something shifted recently. Maybe it was the quiet realization that writing helps me think—and somehow makes me feel at ease. Maybe I finally felt that little fire to share, not for an audience, but for the simple act of putting ideas into words. Maybe writing a blog about the experience and hardship that I have encountered would be a lifeboat and a perfect guide for me in the future when, again, I feel a sense of lost in my mind. So here I am, using a simple template I found on GitHub (I’m not hardcore enough to code a site from scratch), writing these first lines.

I’m not sure who will read this, and that’s okay. This space is for me—to explore ideas that catch my eye, from maths and physics to philosophy and what to eat for dinner. To document a learning journey. To welcome the random and the yet-unknown.

A blog, it turns out, can begin with being late, a conversation, and a friend who wouldn’t let a good idea stay quiet.

...Two years later...

A lot has changed since that conversation. Now I'm no longer a fresher in his first year, I'm a third year undergraduate now, with a clearer mind and a stronger mental model inside myself, and the most important, now I figured it out what I want to do and research about.

Surviving through dozens of projects in many subjects from my first year through out my second year, I found out that my formal coursework hasn't led me to the technical frontiers I find most compelling. While my school's curriculum hasn't yet dived deep into the AI and deep learning topics that spark my curiosity, I haven't waited. For over a year now, starting from sometime in the second semester in my second year at university, I've been on a self-directed journey down the rabbit holes of reinforcement learning and deep learning foundations. There are a few reasons why deep learning caught my attention at this time:
- First, it uses much much more derivatives, integrals, differentitation and many thing that are born from calculus and analyis mathematics. Those are what I have done for a thousand times back to the time when I was in the team competing in the National Physics Olympiad, I slept with them every night and get up with them every morning in my preparation journey.
- Second, it borrows the inspiration from the nature, deep learning borrows the neural architecture that sparks from the biological structure of the human brain, while reinforcement learning embrace the ideas of trial and error in the learning process of nearly every forms of life on the Earth, including us, humans.
- And final, I just want to somehow escape the boring daily life of mine at the time, escaping from the normal workloads of the school and find something out there that I find passionate about that tediousness seems to be something too luxurious to have even a single time.

Through a long time of self-taught about foundations knowledge on deep learning and reinforcment learning, now I found something that my mind, one more time, captivated by its beauty and mystery, the generative power of diffusion models. My background comes from physics, so everything that deep learning brings from physics to AI that could enhance its power is always something so captivating to me. I still remembered that when I learnt about the dynamics of particles of dynamical systems, we have heat transfer between particles in the same materials, say we have a long tube that has one cold end and the other end is hot, then the heat is gradually transfered from the hot end to the cold one. The second one is the internal friction between layers of fluid that flows through an environment, these layers slide onto each other which create frictions and slow down some layer and speed up some other. And the final phenomenon, which you could figured it out following my talk, it is the diffusion process. In that process, the particles start to scatter around a container or an environment and make the entropy of the system higher and eventually end up in a state that the distribution of the particles in the environment is nearly equal everywhere. Somehow, computer scientists have successfully brings the idea of diffusion process into generative models and create start-of-the-art models in image generation, and now they are potentially used for other generation tasks, including text in natural language processing and trajectories/rewards in robotics learning. 

This process of teaching myself complex topics has taught me something crucial: the best way to solidify your understanding is to articulate it clearly for someone else. The idea of this technique of self-taught is easily found in the internet. There are a few keywords when talking about these techniques:
- **Rubber duck debugging**: we, as undergraduates major in computer science/information technology or whichever we call ourselves, may heard about this tehcnique one or two times. This technique tells us that the best way to debug an error in a piece of code is to use a rubber duck, which is innocent and adorable, and teach it about the code we are doing. Every details and piece of materials in our code must be articulated clear enough so that a cute thing like a rubber duck is able to understand. That way, in the next one or two minutes, we might figure out where the bug is and slash it.

- **The Feynman Technique**: the technique is named along one of the most popular physicsists in the world history for his contribution in quantum electrodynamics (QED). He is called the best teacher, best explainer, best scientific communicator in the world due to his curiosity, sense of humour and an unparalleled understanding of physical world and pedagogical talents. The technique is the same as the rubber duck debugging, which tells you to try to articulate an idea that you has just learnt to its most simplest form so that nearly a five-year-old child could understand what you are doing. Based on the complexity of the field he was doing research on, quantum electrodynamics, which I believe to be incomprehensible enough that most of us wouldn't understand what it is talking about, I storngly believe the technique that this man use is the cornerstone for self-taught process.

Eventually, you don't truly know a concept until you can explain it. That's the first reason I'm here now.

This blog, then, is my new tool for thinking. It’s a place where I plan to break down the ideas I’m wrestling with—from the multimodal action spaces in diffusion policies to the exploration-exploitation trade-off in deep reinforcement learning. By writing, I aim to crystallize my own knowledge. And by sharing, I hope to connect with others who are walking a similar, self-guided path. Talking about learning, I have quite a strange opinion, which is what we strive to learn is which thrive us to the top and follow us for the rest of our days, any knowledge that bestowed on us and we, as human beings, taking them for granted would never be the true companions and soon enough they will be replaced or abandoned. If my notes and explanations can help even one fellow learner, that would be a wonderful bonus.

But my interests aren't confined to neural networks and loss functions. I also want to explore a different kind of model here: models of thought. I have a long-standing interest in philosophy, particularly epistemology (how we know what we know, the philosophy about knowledge, mind, wisdom and language) and metaphysics (the nature of reality, existence, objective and subjective matter, etc.). Sometimes, the questions in AI and the questions in philosophy feel surprisingly adjacent. What does it mean for a machine to "learn"? What is the nature of the "world model" an agent builds? What actually is conciousness that we are talking about as if we knew it but it turns out to be a concept that ready to be replaced or re-defined at any time? Writing will allow me to explore these parallels.

So, consider this blog a fusion of my two intellectual tracks. One is technical, focused on understanding and explaining the mechanisms of modern AI. The other is philosophical, focused on questioning the foundations of knowledge and existence that these technologies touch upon.

Enventually, the long journey of persuading me to write a blog of him turns out to be successful than he thought, just earlier than I was ready to hear it. This space is my commitment to the process of learning, thinking, and sharing. I'm not sure exactly where it will lead, but I'm excited to find out.

Welcome.
