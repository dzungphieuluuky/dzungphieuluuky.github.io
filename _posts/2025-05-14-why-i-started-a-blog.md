The first day I come to university, I met this guy. He is an extreme intelligent person, graduated from a famous high school for the gifted in Ho Chi Minh City In other words, he is really really good at maths. At first, he seems to be not so talkative so I don't have the gut to talk to him. But after sharing thoughts on mathematics and physics, finding that he also shares some similar hobbies and interest with me. From that moment, a great yet so humble friendship between me and him that I have never expected has bloomed.

Sometimes he told me about some of his strange ideas on society, anthropology, history and maybe philosophy especially those in ethics. So one day, I told him in the library: "Why don't you start a blog. You would be a great writer, people don't expect to hear these ideas everyday". That little sentence somehow sparks something in him. Since that day, he began to write any he thought about on his google doc sheet. He told me that if he try to build a website before write anything, he would likely to lose all of his motivation to start a blog. So yeah, why not? 

A few months passed by since that day, he has always tried to convince me to start a blog like him. But I refuse. I just think that is some thing so annoying and I don't have any motivation at that moment. But now, something in me finally make its changes, something drives me to publish a website (of course using a template, I'm not that hard core) and start to write these lines. Maybe that I truly want to share my ideas, and now maybe I have enough fire to do that. So, what do you see, a personal blog of mine is finally here.

I don't hope anyone would read these blogs, I just want to write them down, many benefits with that after all. I would share some of my ideas on mathematics and physics that I find interesting, my learning journey and maybe something randomness I haven't known yet.
