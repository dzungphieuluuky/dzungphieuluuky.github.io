The first day I came to university, I met this guy. He is an extremely intelligent person, having graduated from a famous high school for the gifted in Ho Chi Minh City. In other words, he is really really good at maths. At first, he seems not so talkative, so I don't have the guts to talk to him. But after talking for a while with him and sharing some thoughts on mathematics and physics, I found that he also shares some similar hobbies and interests with me. From that moment, a great yet so humble friendship between me and him that I had never expected has bloomed.

Sometimes he told me about some of his strange ideas on society, anthropology, history, and maybe philosophy, especially those in ethics. So one day, I told him in the library: "Why don't you start a blog? You would be a great writer, people don't expect to hear these ideas every day". That little sentence somehow sparks something in him. Since that day, he began to write any he thought about on his Google doc sheet. He told me that if he tried to build a website before writing anything, he would likely to lose all of his motivation to start a blog. So yeah, why not? 

A few months passed by since that day, and he has always tried to convince me to start a blog like his. But I refuse. I just think that is some thing so annoying and I don't have any motivation at that moment. But now, something in me has finally make its changes, something drives me to publish a website (of course using a template, I'm not that hardcore) and start to write these lines. Maybe I truly want to share my ideas, and now maybe I have enough fire to do that. So, what do you see? A personal blog of mine is finally here.

I don't hope anyone would read these blogs, I just want to write them down, many benefits with that after all. I would share some of my ideas on mathematics and physics that I find interesting, my learning journey, and maybe something random I haven't known yet.
