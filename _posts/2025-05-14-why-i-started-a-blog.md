The first day I came to university, I met this guy. He is a smart guy, having graduated from a famous high school in Ho Chi Minh City. In other words, he is really really good at maths. In the first lecture on Introduction to Programming, I came to the class late by about 15 minutes. All the seats seem to be full, only one seat beside this guy's seat is empty, so yeah I jumped right to the seat. 

Some magical forces made us talk a little bit about maths and quantum physics (somehow it led to here). I told something I knew about quantum superposition, entanglement, and maybe something so dark so strange about relativity (these things appeared in VPhO, so yeah, I have something to talk about). After a while, I found that he also shares some similar interests with me, especially in nerdy stuff. Although he is much more interested in religion, belief, nation and kinds of social stuff, I'm more directed to reality, consciousness, space time and metaphysics and anything that looks as separate from humanity as possible His favourite books are *Homo sapiens* and *The Journey of Humanity* so you might expect what was/is/would be in his head. From that moment, a great yet humble friendship between me and him that I had never expected has bloomed (something looks like duality, yin and yang, Naruto and Sasuke, plaplapla).

Sometimes he told me about some of his strange ideas on society, anthropology, history, and maybe philosophy, especially those in ethics. Some of them sometimes sound illegal and out of the world, so maybe a little meditation is required to support anyone hearing these things ðŸ¥². So one day, I told him in the library: "Why don't you start a blog? You would be a great writer, people don't expect to hear these ideas every day". That little sentence somehow sparks something in him. I successfully distracted him for a few days, especially while we were taking the final exam of the semester. Since that day, he began to write anything he thought about on his Google Docs sheet. I also asked him why he hadn't created a website beforehand and uploaded those blogs on the web. He told me that if he tried to build a website before writing anything, he would likely to lose all of his motivation to start a blog. So yeah, why not?

A few months passed by since that day, and he has always tried to convince me to start a blog like his. But I refused. I just thought that this is something so annoying, and I didn't have any motivation at that moment. But now, something in me has finally make its changes, something drives me to publish a website (of course using a template, I'm not that hardcore to code the whole web from scratch) and start to write these lines. Maybe I truly want to share my ideas, and now maybe I have enough fire to do that. Sometimes, I feel that writing somehow makes me feel relaxed and so comfortable. So, what do you see? A personal blog of mine is finally here.

I don't hope anyone would read these blogs, I just want to write them down, many benefits with that after all. I would share some of my ideas on anything I find interesting (maths, physics, philosophy, what to eat this evening?), my learning journey, and maybe something random I haven't known yet.
