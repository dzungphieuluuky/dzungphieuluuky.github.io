Back to my high school, physics is my main interest. I also enrolled in my high school with main focus in physics and gained some achievements in competitions including Vietnam National Physics Olympiad (VPhO). Studying physics taught me a lot about how the world works and how some common principles could be used to predict new events which we don't need to observe them physically ourselves.

When I encountering maths in university, things are getting so discrete with all of Karnaugh maps, boolean algebra and true/false things. Honestly I don't like those things since I was with physics for a long time and everything there was all continuous. They are smooth, fuzzy and has some kind of shape in its representation for you to trace them. Thus I kind of struggled with coursework in university at the some first semesters. Only when I heard that AI and specifically deep learning use more calculus and continuous maths than discrete algebra, I began to see some interest in this field. First I started to learn some basic things about machine learning and as everyone else, the first one you encounter when talking about deep learning is training a neural network on a preprocessed, fixed dataset. At this point, again, I feel boring with this kind of training paradigm. Although learning from data is the most straightforward thing you can think of when talking about training since we need something already good to mimic them. But I want the training to be somehow more elegant. more universal, not relying on any external data and only on the model itself. That is when I know the existence of something called Reinforcement Learning, which helps the agent (aka the model in this context, although the network model itself can be thought of the engine of the agent, not the agent itself).
