Back to my high school, physics is my main interest. I also enrolled in my high school with main focus in physics and gained some achievements in competitions including Vietnam National Physics Olympiad (VPhO). Studying physics taught me a lot about how the world works and how some common principles could be used to predict new events which we don't need to observe them physically ourselves.
