My name is Ph·∫°m Ng·ªçc D≈©ng. I'm currently a second-year university undergrad majoring in information technology fascinated by the intersection of mathematics, computer science and physics.

I gained my interest in physics through participating in the Vietnamese Physics Olympiad (VPhO) in my high school. I'm also interested in reinforcement learning, quantum computing and the interdisciplinary field in between.

In my free time, I love watching science-explained videos on YouTube on a wide range of topics such as calculus, linear algebra, machine learning, deep learning, quantum physics and so much more. Apart from this nerdy habit, I also enjoy reading my favourite anime character's Wikipedia (because I'm not patient enough to watch the series ep-by-ep ü•≤).

In my blog, you will find me sharing my learning journey and ideas on some topics I find interesting.
