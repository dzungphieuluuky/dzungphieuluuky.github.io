My name is Ph·∫°m Ng·ªçc D≈©ng. I'm currently a second-year undergrad in university with a major in information technology  fascinated by the intersection of mathematics, computer science and physics.

I gained my interest in physics through participation in Vietnamese Physics Olympiad (VPhO) in my high school. I'm also interested in reinforcement learning, quantum computing and would like to see the combination of both.

In my free time, I love watching science-explained videos on youtube on a wide range of topics such as calculus, linear algebra, machine learning, deep learning, quantum physics and so much more. Apart from this nerdy habit, I also enjoy reading my favourite anime character Wikipedia (because I'm not patient enough to watch the series ep-by-ep ü•≤).

In my blog, you will find me sharing my learning journey and maybe some of my ideas on philosophy.
