My name is Phạm Ngọc Dũng. I'm currently a second-year undergrad in university with a major in information technology  fascinated by the intersection of mathematics, computer science and physics.  
I participated in Vietnamese Physics Olympiad (VPhO) in my high school. I'm interested in AI especially reinforcement learning and quantum computing.  
In my free time, I love watching science-explained videos on youtube on a wide range of topics such as calculus, linear algebra, machine learning, deep learning, quantum physics and so much more. Apart from these academic interest, I also enjoy reading my favourite character Wikipedia (because I'm not patient enough to watch the series ep-by-ep).  
In my blog, you will find me sharing my learning journey and maybe some of my ideas on philosophy.
