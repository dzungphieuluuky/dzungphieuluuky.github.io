# Personal Info
My full name is Ph·∫°m Ng·ªçc D≈©ng. I'm currently a second-year university undergraduate student majoring in information technology.  

I'm a science enthusiast and a student fascinated by the intersection of mathematics, computer science, and physics. 

# Interests
Currently, my main interests are:
- [**Reinforcement Learning**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning): a subfield of machine learning focused on creating agents that can interact and learn from the environment.
- [**Quantum Computing**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing): an interdisciplinary field that tries to harness the power of quantum mechanics to bring about a new approach to computing.

# Favourite Channels
Watching YouTube is one of my ways of burning time when I'm free, some of my favourite channels are:
- [**3Blue1Brown**](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown): a must-watch channel for those who love maths.
- [**Richard Behiel**](https://www.youtube.com/@RichBehiel): a nice guy with a PhD aiming to explain advanced physics concepts.
- [**Physics Explained**](https://www.youtube.com/@PhysicsExplainedVideos): another guy with a deep understanding of physics trying to explain formulas from their birth.
- [**Veritasium**](https://www.youtube.com/@veritasium): a channel for anyone burned continuously with curiosity and desire to expand knowledge.
- [**Fireship**](https://www.youtube.com/@Fireship): coding channel with lightspeed way of explaining things.

# My idols
- [**Richard Feynman**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman): for his sense of humour, deep understanding of physics, and great way of teaching.
- [**John von Neumann**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann): for his absolute power in many different fields of mathematics.

# Maths I like and don't like
- Like: linear algebra, calculus, complex numbers, differential/integral maths.
- Don't like: combinatorics, graph theory, number theory.
- Not sure on which side: discrete maths.

# Generalist / Specialist
I would say that I look like a generalist more than a specialist (just think so).

# Non nerdy hobbies
- Reading my favourite anime character's Wikipedia (because I'm not patient enough to watch the series ep-by-ep ü•≤).
- Watching study vlogs.
- Best anime fights that I find masterpieces.

Also, I prefer to do anything at night. The daylight, especially in the afternoon, somehow drains all of my power.
