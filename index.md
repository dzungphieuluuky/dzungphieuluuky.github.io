# Introduction

Hi there I'm dzungphieuluuky. I'm currently an undergraduate student and an enthusiast in physics and deep learning. This is my portfolio website to update my achievements and share my experience via writing blogs.

I'm fascinated by the intersection of mathematics, computer science, and physics. Mathematically speaking, I'm quite interested in continuous mathematics that has stochastic, complex and dynamical properties.

# Research Interests

Currently, my main interests are:

-  **Reinforcement Learning**: Sample efficiency, exploration-exploitation trade-offs, high performance computing for environment simulation.
-  **Generative Modeling**: Diffusion models, environment simulation with diffusion-based sampling, disentanglement in latent spaces.
-  **Large Language Models**: Looped language models, recursive language models, small language models.
-  **Quantum Computing**: Quantum machine learning and quantum information science.

# Favourite Channels

Watching YouTube is one of my ways of burning time when I'm free, some of my favourite channels are:

- [**3Blue1Brown**](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown): a must-watch channel for those who love maths, especially visualized maths.
- [**Richard Behiel**](https://www.youtube.com/@RichBehiel): a nice guy with a PhD aiming to explain advanced physics concepts. He has some videos talking about quantum electrodynamics or something similar that last for around 3 hours :D.
- [**Physics Explained**](https://www.youtube.com/@PhysicsExplainedVideos): another guy with a deep understanding of physics trying to explain formulas from their birth.
- [**Veritasium**](https://www.youtube.com/@veritasium): a channel for anyone burned continuously with curiosity and desire to expand knowledge.
- [**Fireship**](https://www.youtube.com/@Fireship): coding channel with lightspeed way of explaining things, suitable for those who needs some speed to focus.

# My Idols

- [**Richard Feynman**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman): for his sense of humour, deep understanding of physics, and great way of explaining things.
- [**John von Neumann**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann): for his absolute power in many different fields of mathematics.

# Mathematics taste
- Like: linear algebra, calculus, complex numbers and its families (quarternions and siblings), differential equations: ordinary/partial/stochastic differential equations.
- Don't like: combinatorics, graph theory, number theory.

# What have I been up to

## Font Diffusion
A research project where I try to develop methods for generating high quality images for Sino Nom language, an ancient language in historical sripts. The generated image blends the content of one input image and style of another input image. This project is the one that has sparked my interest with diffusion models recently.

## Ouro Trace
This is my capstone project for the course Introduction to Machine Learning. In this project, I experimented with a looped language model called Ouro-1.4B-Thinking, which is one member in the Ouroboros family developed by ByteDance. I managed to survive through a lot of difficulties doing this project due to my inexperience with NLP because my previous projects are mainly around reinforcement learning :D. I think the difficulties also come from the different nature of looped transformer architecture compared to traditional transformers. Learnt a lot, definitely.

## Energy Management with RL
I have done this project as part of my participation of Viettel AI Race, where I had to develop an inteligent agent to autonomously control and orchestrate the output burst of cells in a energy grid depending on the energy demands at hand. This challenge is quite hard since I was doing it alone along with several courses (I registered 6 courses in the same semester beside this thing). Learnt quite much about the behaviour of PPO and SAC training, experience the notoriously famous instability of RL training with my own eyes :D

## This website
A beautiful template from [**Beautiful Jekyll**](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) where I'm going to share some of my personal experience while I was doing my projects and some interesting thoughts (I think) about developing intelligent architectures and loss functions.

# Fun facts
- I'm most productive during night time. You can even say that I draw my power from the darkness as Hela draws her power from Asgard.
- I enjoy reading anime character wikipedias rather than actually watching that exactly anime series. Quite excited to do research about my favourite anime characters.
- My learning fuel: curiosity and probably too much coffee everyday intake.
- I'm apparently a generalist rather than a specialist (maybe).

<!-- # Strengths

- I feel that I have a strong sense of language understanding. I can feel quite lots of intangible things related to natural languages, including the subtle difference between synonyms, which we consider to have the same meaning.
- Around 90% of my knowledge and exprience come from my own self study journey rather than my formal academic studies at schools (now university). I think I'm quite similar to an autodidact, that guy who learns everything he wants, which in my case, everything that I found to be fancy enough.

# Weaknesses

- Immense amount of imposter syndrome, the bullshit phenomenon that drastically pull you down by yourself. Basically speaking, I'm the greatest enemy of myself.
- Idiosyncratic attitude, rage is one of my uncontrollable and unexpected characteristic that I feel it so annoying. Therefore, I'm trying to build my own serenity through my trained habits and sense of humour to neutralize that immense ammount of rage in myself. I believe the real power lies between rage and serenity (yup, inspired from professor X from X-Men), now that I already have rage, serenity is only thing left to go.
- Perfectionsism. Actually, this is some kind of siblings to the imposter syndrome that I mentioned two bullet points before. Sometimes, it drives me to finish something as full fledged and end-to-end as possible, some other times, it drives me to craziness or gives me unfathomable amount of stress and unsatisfaction. Still working a lot to tame this beast :D -->
