# About Me
Hi there I'm dzungphieuluuky. I'm currently an undergraduate student and an enthusiast in physics and deep learning.

I'm fascinated by the intersection of mathematics, computer science, and physics. 

# Interests
Currently, my main interests are:
- **Reinforcement Learning**: a machine learning subfield to train an agent to do something automatically for you.
- **Quantum Computing**: a field increasingly gain more popularity in community and hope to build super computer with the help of quantum phenomena.
- **Diffusion Models**: a kind of models that's inspired from diffusion process to build generative model, which is kind of surprising from my own perspective.

# Favourite Channels
Watching YouTube is one of my ways of burning time when I'm free, some of my favourite channels are:
- [**3Blue1Brown**](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown): a must-watch channel for those who love maths.
- [**Richard Behiel**](https://www.youtube.com/@RichBehiel): a nice guy with a PhD aiming to explain advanced physics concepts.
- [**Physics Explained**](https://www.youtube.com/@PhysicsExplainedVideos): another guy with a deep understanding of physics trying to explain formulas from their birth.
- [**Veritasium**](https://www.youtube.com/@veritasium): a channel for anyone burned continuously with curiosity and desire to expand knowledge.
- [**Fireship**](https://www.youtube.com/@Fireship): coding channel with lightspeed way of explaining things.

# My Idols
- [**Richard Feynman**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman): for his sense of humour, deep understanding of physics, and great way of teaching.
- [**John von Neumann**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann): for his absolute power in many different fields of mathematics.

# Maths I like and don't like
- Like: linear algebra, calculus, complex numbers, differential equations (I'm quite interested in continuous things).
- Don't like: combinatorics, graph theory, number theory.

# What have I been up to
- **RL Dummy Agents:** Tweaking with some RL algorithms and watch them playing around in Gymnasium environments.
- **This website:** A beautiful template from [**Beautiful Jekyll**](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll).

# Fun Facts About Me
- I'm most productive during nighttime hours
- I read anime character wikis instead of watching series (patience level: 0)
- I enjoy best anime fight scenes (with 60fps if possible to please my eyes)
- My learning fuel: curiosity and probably too much coffee everyday intake
- I'm still deciding if I like discrete mathematics or not
- I'm apparently a generalist rather than a specialist (maybe)
