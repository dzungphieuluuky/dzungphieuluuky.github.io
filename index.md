# About Me
Hi there I'm dzungphieuluuky. I'm currently an undergraduate student and an enthusiast in physics and deep learning. This is my personal portfolio website to update my achievements and share my experience via writing blogs.

I'm fascinated by the intersection of mathematics, computer science, and physics. 

# Interests
Currently, my main interests are:
- **Reinforcement Learning**: a machine learning subfield where you train an agent to do something smart and automatically for you, such as energy management, traffic control or game playing, etc.
- **Quantum Computing**: a field increasingly gain more popularity in community and hope to build super computer with the help of quantum phenomena.
- **Diffusion Models**: a family of generative models inspired from diffusion process of particles in physics that are used to generate images, texts and maybe more. I find the mechanism of this guy quite interesting and worth learning.

# Favourite Channels
Watching YouTube is one of my ways of burning time when I'm free, some of my favourite channels are:
- [**3Blue1Brown**](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown): a must-watch channel for those who love maths, especially visualized maths.
- [**Richard Behiel**](https://www.youtube.com/@RichBehiel): a nice guy with a PhD aiming to explain advanced physics concepts. He has some videos talking about quantum electrodynamics or something similar that last for around 3 hours :D.
- [**Physics Explained**](https://www.youtube.com/@PhysicsExplainedVideos): another guy with a deep understanding of physics trying to explain formulas from their birth.
- [**Veritasium**](https://www.youtube.com/@veritasium): a channel for anyone burned continuously with curiosity and desire to expand knowledge.
- [**Fireship**](https://www.youtube.com/@Fireship): coding channel with lightspeed way of explaining things, suitable for those who needs some speed to focus.

# My Idols
- [**Richard Feynman**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman): for his sense of humour, deep understanding of physics, and great way of explaining things.
- [**John von Neumann**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann): for his absolute power in many different fields of mathematics.

# Maths I like and don't like
- Like: linear algebra, calculus, complex numbers, differential equations (I'm quite interested in continuous things).
- Don't like: combinatorics, graph theory, number theory.

# What have I been up to
- **RL Dummy Agents:** Tweaking with some RL algorithms and watch them playing around in Gymnasium environments.
- **This website:** A beautiful template from [**Beautiful Jekyll**](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll).

# Fun Facts About Me
- I'm most productive during night time, when the darkness gives me power.
- I enjoy reading anime character wikipedias rather than actually watching series.
- I enjoy best anime fight scenes (with 60fps if possible to please my eyes)
- My learning fuel: curiosity and probably too much coffee everyday intake
- I'm still deciding if I like discrete mathematics or not
- I'm apparently a generalist rather than a specialist (maybe)
